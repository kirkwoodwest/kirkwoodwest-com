My journey in music and technology began in the 80s, a time marked by the emergence of groundbreaking electronic devices. Armed with a boombox, a Casio keyboard, a microphone, and an Atari 800, I embarked on a path that would shape my future. As a four year old, tools were my early teachers, guiding me through my first experiences in sound manipulation and digital creativity.</p> <p>From experimenting with the SK-1's sampling capabilities to exploring the basics of programming on the Atari 800, each experience deepened my understanding and passion for music and technology. My approach has always been about blending the familiar with the innovative, continually pushing boundaries to discover new possibilities in sound and digital art.
